## Problem 1

Next, run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and
50. For each group size, compute the probability that at least two
people in the group will share a birthday by averaging across the 10000
simulation runs. Make a plot showing the probability as a function of
group size, and comment on your results.

``` r
bday_sim = function(n){
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n 
  
  return(duplicate)
}
```

``` r
prob_shared = c()

for (n in 2:50){
  
  num_shared = 0
  
  for (i in 1:10000){
    
    if (bday_sim(n) == TRUE){
      
      num_shared = num_shared + 1
      
    }
  }
  prob_shared = c(prob_shared, num_shared/10000)
}
```

``` r
samp_size = 2:50
bday_df = data.frame(samp_size, prob_shared)

bday_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = samp_size, y = prob_shared)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(size = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Group Size versus Probability of Shared Birthdays",
    x = "Group Size", 
    y = "Prob Shared Birthday"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

As the graph shows, the probability of having at least two people
sharing the same birthday increases sharply as the group size increases
at first until it hits 50%. After this, the growth slows down as it
approaches 100% but does not fully reach it.
